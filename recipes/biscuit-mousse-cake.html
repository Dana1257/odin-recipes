        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cake is extremely delicious. After having one piece I can't wait to devour another. The cake will keep in the fridge up to two weeks. On the counter for about two days. Either way you'll want to wrap the cake in parchment paper and then cling film to properly store it.</p>
