        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cake is extremely delicious. After having one piece I can't wait to devour another. The cake will keep in the fridge up to two weeks.</b> On the counter for about two days. Either way you'll want to wrap the cake in parchment paper and then cling film to properly store it. </p>
