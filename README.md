This project is a list of links to recipes. I am creating it to illustrate the html and css skills that I have learned from The Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. 

This project will also allow me to practice using Git and Github.

This has been an interesting project to work on. I learned a lot about how everything comes together to create a simple website.
